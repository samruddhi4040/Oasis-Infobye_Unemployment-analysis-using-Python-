Hey! 

We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.                                                   
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. 

The task was to analyze unemployment rate in India using Python.

Packages such as pandas, numpy & seaborn were put to use for the task.                        
I've also uploaded the dataset used by me for completing this task. 
 
For this, I first had to checkout whether the dataset has any inconsistency and then using necessary packages, libraries and other data visualization tools.                     

To determine the unemployment rate, the data was categorized on the basis on states, regions (North / South / West / East) & on their areas (rural or urban).
